# Aaron Witting's Github; Welcome!

## Information about me:
My name is Aaron Witting and I am from [*Boonville, Missouri*](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82839703/116466622-5901fb80-a834-11eb-86bd-f229845be023.png). I grew up twenty minutes away from Columbia and the University of Missouri's campus. I consider myself a "local" even though I am not originally from Columbia. I have lived my whole life in Boonville. All the schools I attended in my nineteen years of living have been in Boonville, other than college of course. I am excited to get out of my comfort zone a bit by coming to a large university such as Mizzou. I have taken other steps to expand my horizons other than going to a large school. I have also joined a fraternity since being here. I am a member of the [Alpha Gamma Sigma](http://agsig.org/) fraternity. My life has been fairly quiet and I am very excited to be here at Mizzou beginning my career!

**Go Tigers!**

### Levels of Education:
1. Elementary School
2. Middle School
3. High School
4. University (current)

### Some of my previous work:
My [IT 1600 Final](https://github.com/awitting20/IT-1600-Final.git)

while True:
    try:
        radius = float(input("What is the radius?" ))
        break
    except ValueError:
        print("The input is invalid. Re-enter value.")


while True:
    try:
        height = float(input("What is the height?" ))
        break
    except ValueError:
        print("The input is invalid. Re-enter value.")

volume = 3.14 * (radius * radius) * height

print("The volume is", volume)

**This is a code for solving the volume of a cylinder. Just a taste of programming challenges I have completed** 

### Future Goals:
The future is not set for me. I am not exactly sure what I want to do or where I want to be, but it does not bother me as much as it probably should. I'm more about living in the moment and letting life lead me where it wants me to go. That said, I do want to get a degree in Information Technology, find a career, have a family, and travel the country and world at some point. They are generic goals, but they drive me to do my best.
