# Aaron Witting's Github; Welcome!

## Information about me:
My name is Aaron Witting and I am from [*Boonville, Missouri*](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82839703/116466622-5901fb80-a834-11eb-86bd-f229845be023.png). I grew up twenty minutes away from Columbia and the University of Missouri's campus. I consider myself a "local" even though I am not originally from Columbia. I have lived my whole life in Boonville. All the schools I attended in my nineteen years of living have been in Boonville, other than college of course. My life has been fairly quiet and I am very excited to be here at Mizzou beginning my career!
